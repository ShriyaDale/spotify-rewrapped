### Inspiration
In 2025, over 300 million users engaged with Spotify Wrapped, highlighting how much people love seeing their music story visualized and shared. Music has become one of the most personal forms of self-express, reflecting our moods and identities, yet most streaming platforms reduce this rich, complex data to generic playlists and surface-level recommendations. Wrapped only appears once a year, after disappearing forever, leaving users without a way to continuously explore and understand their evolving music tastes. Many listeners prefer a deeper, always-available way to showcase their curated tastes, connect with others with similar vibes, and see how their preferences may change in the future. That’s why we created Rewrapped, an AI-powered music discovery platform that brings a smarter, evolving version of your music journey to life, helping you express who you are, connect globally, and explore the sound of your future.

### What It Does
Our website, Rewrapped, transforms the way you experience music through personalized, AI powered discovery. Rewrapped features My DNA, Discovery, World Map, Forecast, and Concert Radar features. My DNA highlights favorite artists, top tracks, and overall listening mood. Showcasing the music in the user’s DNA, indices of groove, brightness, heat, and pace, are displayed. Moreover, a mood radar exhibits the energy of the user. In Discovery, you can receive song recommendations based on music you already love, effortlessly finding your next favorite track. The ElevenLabs DJ feature is also showcased here, allowing speech-to-speech conversations to play tracks from your top songs, pause, and skip music. The World Map connects you to countries with similar music tastes, letting you explore global listening trends that match your tastes. Forecast predicts what you’re likely to be listening to in the future, giving you a glimpse into your evolving tastes. Finally, Concert Radar keeps you updated on upcoming artists you love, so you’ll never miss a live show.

### How We Built It
We brushed up on our TypeScript and web development skills by watching various tutorials from Youtube. In addition, we used APIs in which we had previous experience such as Groq, the Spotify API, and the Discovery API (Ticketmaster). However, we did learn how to use ElevenLabs to integrate a personal DJ to play your favorite tracks, which we learned how to do by reading documentation offered on their site.

### Challenges We Ran Into
We ran into various issues regarding API Keys; initially, we had planned to utilize Together AI in the Forecast feature of Rewrapped. However, unable to receive access tokens, we switched to Grok which was free of use and allowed for unlimited tokens to be generated. This further allowed us to do in-depth testing as we did not have to be cautious of prompt numbers. Additionally, we ran into challenges regarding Spotify’s API in which our access tokens expired and would not refresh properly; though this had initially caused a hurdle as all of our features require Spotify user data, though this was quickly fixed.

### Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
We are proud of our mission and how we were able to reimagine music discovery and reflection in a more interactive and personal way, ensuring users feel understood through their music DNA, AI-powered predictions, and global taste connections, especially in a world where streaming platforms often overlook individuality beyond generic recommendations.


### What We Learned
We learned how to use ElevenLabs’ speech-to-speech functionality in order to create a more personalized DJ that can play songs from your top tracks, pause, and skip to the next one. We also got the opportunity to hone our skills in Typescript, along with using git and GitHub through the software development lifecycle.

### What's Next For ReWrapped
We would like to implement a Twin Taste tab that pulls data from Spotify users with similar listening habits to connect you with people who share your top artists and tracks, allowing you to build connections and discover curated playlists from like-minded listeners.
